    "The log-odds ratio with an informative (and uninformative) Dirichlet prior (described in [Monroe et al. 2009, Fighting Words](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Monroe.pdf)) is a common method for finding distinctive terms in two datasets (see [Jurafsky et al. 2014](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4944/3863) for an example article that uses it to make an empirical argument). This method for finding distinguishing words combines a number of desirable properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* it specifies an intuitive metric (the log-odds) for the ratio of two probabilities\n",
    "* it can incorporate prior information in the form of pseudocounts, which can either act as a smoothing factor (in the uninformative case) or incorporate real information about the expected frequency of words overall.\n",
    "* it accounts for variability of a frequency estimate by essentially converting the log-odds to a z-score.\n",

    "The selected dataset for this assignment comprises two classic literary works from Project Gutenberg: Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" and a collection of Brazilian Tales by various authors, including pieces from the renowned Brazilian novelist Machado de Assis (one of my favorite Brazilian authors). I chose these two texts due to their allegedly rich linguistic content, and both significantly exceeded the minimum requirement of 10,000 tokens for analysis. Moreover, I also wanted to analyze a text originally written in a different language, considering that the translation process might impact the vocabulary richness and complexity of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in line with the class objectives of exploring and working with personal data, two additional datasets were included. One dataset is my own Statement of Purpose, used for my admission to the MIMS program here at Cal. The second dataset consists of an essay generated by Chat GPT, leveraging the GPT-3.5 model, with a similar goal of crafting a Statement of Purpose for myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diversity of these datasets, from classic literature to personal narratives and AI-generated text, promises a multifaceted exploration of natural language processing techniques and the opportunity to gain insights into the distinctive linguistic features that characterize each text category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Information:** For the ChatGPT-generated essay, I used the prompt: \"Write a Statement of Purpose for Filipe Santos' application to a Master's program in Information Management and Systems at the University of California Berkeley. The Statement of Purpose should describe Filipe's relevant academic and professional experience and accomplishments, his future professional goals once the degree is acquired, and why he is drawn to the MIMS program and believes it would be a good fit for him and his goals. Filipe is a Brazilian industrial engineer with extensive experience in the tech world, being part of an early-stage startup from the beginning until its successful M&A. Filipe is also very interested in Smart Cities and how relevant education is as a transformational factor. The essay should be 2-3 pages long.\""
